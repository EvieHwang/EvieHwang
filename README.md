# Hi, I'm Eve Hwang 👋

Product Manager building AI-powered solutions for supply chain and logistics.

I work at Amazon on the Community Delivery program, where I design systems for demand forecasting, inventory management, and operational automation. My focus is applying AI and ML to solve real-world supply chain problems—not just building models, but shipping products that work at scale.

## What I'm working on

🔗 **Supply chain AI** — Building automation agents and forecasting tools for food distribution networks  
📦 **WM2** — An open-source tool for predicting product weights and dimensions from text descriptions  
🤖 **MCP integrations** — Developing agentic workflows that connect AI models to operational systems

## Background

Before Amazon, I led technology initiatives at Food Lifeline and served as Chair of the Greater Seattle Business Association. I've spent my career at the intersection of technology and operations—from fraud detection systems to enterprise applications to community impact programs.

I'm particularly interested in how AI changes the product management discipline itself: how we scope problems, validate solutions, and ship iteratively when the underlying technology is evolving rapidly.
