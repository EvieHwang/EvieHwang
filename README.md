# Hi, I'm Eve 👋

I build AI-powered tools for operational problems—supply chain, logistics, fraud detection—and I think a lot about how product managers need to evolve to work effectively with LLM-based systems.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of product strategy and technical implementation. I prototype, I write evaluation frameworks, and I believe PMs who can't read the code are going to struggle to build good AI products.

## What I'm working on

🔧 **Agentic systems** — Tool-augmented agents that make decisions, not just predictions. My [WM2 project](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2) demonstrates the full pattern: Claude-based agent with semantic search, structured evaluation framework, AWS serverless deployment.

📊 **AI evaluation** — Building evals into the code, not bolting them on afterward. WM2 includes an Agent Performance Framework implementation with gate metrics, pillar metrics, and provenance tracking.

🤖 **LLM applications for operations** — At Amazon, I built a program assistant using structured context (which outperformed RAG for our use case) that generates SQL, prepares QBRs, and analyzes support tickets. It's now used across the team.

⚡ **Prototyping as a PM discipline** — I think the PMs who thrive in AI will be the ones who can branch the repo, try an architectural change, and show their thinking to engineers. That's how I work.

## Recent work

At **Amazon**, I led product for Community Delivery (15M+ meals/year to food-insecure households). The win I'm most proud of: partners' #1 request was order individualization for dietary needs. Through a site visit, I discovered the real need was route timing and staging data—not inventory integration. That reframe became the program's top 2026 priority.

At **Nordstrom**, I built an automated inventory repositioning system that contributed $22M in pilot EBIT, plus time-series forecasting used across Merchandising, Supply Chain, and Store Operations.

Earlier, I spent six years as **Director of Technology at Food Lifeline**, a $72M food bank supply chain. Led IT for a 200k sq ft warehouse buildout. Chaired Feeding America's national technology consortium.

## What I'm thinking about

- How evaluation methodology changes when you're assessing agent behavior, not model accuracy
- The gap between "PM who uses AI tools" and "PM who can build AI products"
- Structured prompting vs. RAG—when each makes sense
- Why the best AI products will be built by small teams who own the full stack
