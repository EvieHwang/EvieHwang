# Hi, I'm Eve 👋

Product Manager learning to build with AI. I'm working through how generative AI changes the way we design supply chain systems, and how it changes the PM role itself.

## What I'm learning

🔧 **Agentic systems for supply chain** — Agentic capabilities will make supply chain systems more adaptive and organic. I'm exploring how to envision, resource, and build them.

📊 **Evaluation frameworks** — Evaluation is part of development, not a separate activity. Evaluators have to be written into the code from the start, and I'm working out how to do that as a PM in partnership with SDEs. My [WM2 project](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2) is my learning lab for this.

⚙️ **Spec-driven development** — Enterprises have moved beyond vibe-coding. I'm building out a workflow where specs drive implementation: specifications → plans → tasks → code. This repo is managed that way, using [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and Claude Code. I'm interested in how PMs can participate in this pattern as authors, not just reviewers.

🧠 **Keeping up as the landscape shifts** — RAG used to be the answer to everything; now it's one tool among many. I'm curious about MCP, A2A, front-end design specs, and when fine-tuning will be in range for PMs to engage with directly. The knowledge base changes fast and I'm trying to stay current.

## What I'm building

**[WM2](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2)** — An AI-powered warehouse classification system. It's a learning project where I'm working through agentic patterns, semantic search, evaluation frameworks, and AWS deployment. The README is thorough and the Issues are current if you want to see how I think.

## Recent work

At **Amazon**, I lead product for Community Delivery (15M+ meals/year to food-insecure households). Much of my work is enhanced by an AI assistant contextualized with structured program information and performance measures.

At **Nordstrom**, I built an automated inventory repositioning system ($22M pilot EBIT) and a time-series forecasting tool used across Merchandising, Supply Chain, and Store Operations.

## What I'm thinking about

- How do PMs and SDEs work together when you're building with AI *and* building something that uses AI? What does that product operations workflow look like?
- What's the design system for spec-based coding in the enterprise? How do specs, evals, and heuristics fit together as a discipline?
- Where have we accepted that algorithmic approaches to supply chain are too expensive or too constrained—and could agentic capabilities solve those problems differently?
- Where does human judgment actually belong in a workflow?
