# Hi, I'm Eve 👋

Product manager learning to build. I'm deep in the weeds figuring out how generative AI changes the way we design supply chain systems—and how it changes the PM role itself.

## What I'm learning

🔧 **Agentic systems for supply chain** — I think predictive, agentic behavior—models that can make choices and act inside complex frameworks—is going to make supply chain systems more adaptable and organic. Right now these systems are tightly configured and brittle. I'm exploring what it looks like when they're not.

📊 **Evaluation frameworks** — You can't bolt evals on afterward. I'm working through how to write evaluators into the code from the start, especially for agent behavior where traditional accuracy metrics don't apply. My [WM2 project](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2) is my learning lab for this.

⚙️ **Spec-driven development with Claude Code** — I've been building a workflow where specs drive implementation: specifications → plans → tasks → code. This repo is managed that way. I'm interested in how PMs can use this pattern to prototype and generate their own evals without waiting for engineering cycles.

🧠 **Keeping up with how knowledge keeps changing** — RAG used to be the answer to everything; now it's one tool among many. I'm curious about when fine-tuning will be in range for PMs to think about directly. The landscape shifts fast and I'm trying to stay honest about what I actually understand vs. what I've just read about.

## What I'm building

**[WM2](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2)** — An AI-powered warehouse classification system. It's a learning project, not a production product, but it's where I'm working through agentic patterns, semantic search, evaluation frameworks, and AWS deployment. The README is thorough if you want to see how I think.

**This repo** — Managed with a spec-driven workflow using Claude Code. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) defines agent autonomy settings; [specs/](specs/) contains the specifications. I'm using my own profile as a testbed for the workflow I want to use on real products.

## Recent work

At **Amazon**, I led product for Community Delivery (15M+ meals/year to food-insecure households). The win I'm most proud of: partners' #1 request was order individualization for dietary and cultural needs. Through a site visit, I discovered the real need was route timing and staging data—not inventory integration. That reframe became the program's top 2026 priority.

At **Nordstrom**, I built an automated inventory repositioning system ($22M pilot EBIT) and time-series forecasting used across Merchandising, Supply Chain, and Store Operations.

Earlier: six years as **Director of Technology at Food Lifeline**, a $72M food bank supply chain.

## What I'm thinking about

- How agentic AI changes the relationship between investors and executors—and whether middle management survives the transition
- When fine-tuning becomes something a PM can realistically do, not just talk about
- The gap between "PM who uses AI tools" and "PM who can build AI products"
- Why supply chain is such a good domain for this work: complex, high-stakes, data-rich, and full of tightly coupled systems that need to become more adaptive
